# Hello!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## Who Am I? 🤔
I'm a **Python apprentice** from Brazil 🇧🇷. In the road I've taken, it led me to learn and exercise the art of accounting, and that road also led me to the exciting realm of data analysis and project management. And walking this road, I've found my passion in coding, working with data, thinking and (now) building my own projects while having a good cup of hot coffee. ☕

## What I Do? 💻
Here on GitHub I get to share my little projects with you. From data analysis to Python scripts, each repository is a piece of my journey in coding, and feel free to help if you can! 

## What I'm working on? ⛏️
Right now my pet project is the **B3 Analyzer**, a web app that shows data analysis based on the investments statements from B3, the stock market exchange from Brazil. The user can download their own statements in the B3 website, upload them to the app and it will show analysis of their investments.

## Join Me! 🚀
Your support fuels my journey. It enables me to learn, create, and share more projects with you. So, why not join me? Let's navigate this coding adventure together!

## Thank You! 🙏
A big thank you for the visit, and for your part of my journey too. Let's keep on keeping on! 🙌☕🐍
