# Hi there!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a **python junior developer** from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·.

I have experience in accounting, data analysis and project management, and I'm using python to automate tasks, process data and help me and my team reach their goals.

Also, Ilike to make personal projects to help me with things outside of work (like the B3 Analyzer and Sapo Saver) and share them here.

If you want to reach out, you can access my LinkedIn profile and send me a message.
